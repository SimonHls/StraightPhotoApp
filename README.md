# StraightPhotoApp
*This app helps take straight photos relative to a reference plane.*
The reference plane can be set by placing the phone on a reference surface and pressing the "calibrate" button. 
After arming the camera, a photo will automatically be taken when the phone is parallel to the reference surface. 
This allows you to take a photo that looks straight onto a surface.
The photos can then be previewed and saved or deleted.

I wrote this app to take photos to train an AI Model with. 
Written in React-Native. Free to use.
